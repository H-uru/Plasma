**
**  Information regarding the development of Components for Plasma 2.0
**  
**  Date:       3/2/2001
**  Version:    Plasma 2.00 
**  Needs:      A working knowledge of max sdk (Specifically the ParamBlocks...)
**              A working knowledge of C++              
**
**
**  As the components are heavily reliant on the use of the MAX paramblock, the following methodology
**  should be used in their implementation:
**
**  In order for the paramblock to not be thrown away during linking, we have started the use of a
**  dummy function such as:
**
**      void DummyCodeIncludeStartPointFunc()
**      {
**      }
**
**  This is called within the code for the GlobalUtility function, currently.
**
**  Next create a derived class from the plComponent class with three public functions,
**  being its constunctor, its custom destructor and the converter.  Currently, we have the
**  converter returning an hsBool to let you know how successful the conversion process has been
**  during export to the .prd format.
**
**  After the class above has been declared, the param block stuff follows:
**
**      (Note all the imformation specifics regarding how to develop the paramblocks can be found
**      in the help included in the maxsdk.)
**
**  CLASS_DESC is a macro that Max has created that helps stuff your data into a param block.  It
**  takes in the following formal parameters:
**
**  CLASS_DESC(plStartingPointComponent, gStartPtDesc, "StartingPoint",  "StartingPointComp", Class_ID(0x2a127b68, 0xdc7367a))
**
**      1st parameter : The C++ class that is going to be accessing this function (assumed to be passed by reference)
**      2nd parameter : The Instance of the class descriptor that will be used specifically for 
**                          the following param block.  It is type int.
**      3rd parameter : The Short name description string for this paramblock.
**      4th parameter : The long name description string for this paramblock.
**      5th parameter : The unique CLASS_ID created via the included GEN_ID.exe that comes with maxsdk.
**
**  Following this macro, an enum array is useful to store the relatively unique ID constants for the paramblock.
**
**  The format of the definitions in this shown below, but basically is in the form of a sequence of fixed specs followed by a variable number of tagged optional specs for each parameter. 
**
**
**  Next, the actual param block is declared such as the following:
**
**  ParamBlockDesc2 gStartPtBk
**      (
**      1, _T(""), 0, &gStartPtDesc, P_AUTO_CONSTRUCT + P_AUTO_UI, 0,
**  
**      //rollout
**      IDD_COMP_STARTINGPOINT, IDS_COMP_STARTINGPOINTS, 0, 0, NULL,
**  
**      // params
**      kPlayerStartingPoint,       _T("Start Point:"),     TYPE_STRING,        0, 0,   
**      p_ui,           TYPE_EDITBOX, IDC_COMP_STARTPOINT,
**      end,
**  
**      end
**      );
**
**  First is the name of the descriptor method that is to be used, in this case the ParamBlockDesc2
**  type.  Second is the unique name of this this paramblock.  Following, a collection of comma delimited
**  parameters ensue.  The exact details as well as other flags to use herein can be found in the MaxR4 sdk
**  Help file.  We shall explain the above parameters to help give you an idea of the layout.
**  All paramblocks have the following format:  
**
**       1. Required block specs & per-block flags, followed by,
**       2. Optional owning object reference number for the block if auto-construct, followed by,
**       3. Optional parameter map specs if auto-ui, followed by,
**       4. Zero or more parameter specs, comprising:
**            a. Required parameter specs, followed by,
**            b. Zero or more optional parameter specs, each with is own leading tag, 
**               the list terminated by an 'end' tag, followed by,
**       5. an 'end' tag
**
**  THE BLOCK SPECS:
**
**      BlockParameter 1:  
**                  "1" is the permanent block ID for the parameter block2.  It must be unique
**                  to the block.  Considering that you can have several blocks stored together in the same window,
**                  you may want to enum this as well.  THIS IS A REQUIRED FIELD.
**      
**      BlockParameter 2: 
**                  The internal name string.  This name is not localized. Internal names are meant
**                  to be parsable as identifiers.  As such they should begin with an alpha character, have only 
**                  alphanumerics, and have no spaces, punctuations, etc.  The convention for multi-uint16_t names 
**                  is to use studly-caps, eg, paintRadius.  THIS IS A REQUIRED FIELD.
**
**      BlockParameter 3:  
**                  The resource ID of the localized (sub-anim) name string.  It is of type int.  THIS IS
**                  A REQUIRED FIELD.
**
**      BlockParameter 4: 
**                  Points to the class descriptor2 of the owning class.  This is used to add this 
**                  descriptor to the ClassDesc2's table of block descriptors for the class. Note: This value may 
**                  be passed as NULL for situations where the blocks owning ClassDesc2 is not available for static 
**                  initializations (such as in a separate file).  Before using the descriptor for any block 
**                  construction, the ClassDesc2* must be initialized with the method:
**
**                  void ParamBlockDesc2::SetClassDesc(ClassDesc2* cd);
**
**                  You can only call this method once on a descriptor and then only if it has been 
**                  constructed initially with a NULL cd.
**
**      BlockParameter 5:  One or more BYTE flags.  In this instance, we are only using:
**                  
**                  P_AUTO_CONSTRUCT
**                          Indicates the parameter block2 will be constructed and referenced automatically 
**                          to its owner in the call to ClassDesc2::MakeAutoParamBlocks().  If this flag is 
**                          set, the parameter block's reference number in the owning object should be given 
**                          immediately following the flag uint16_t in the descriptor constructor.  See 
**                          <auto_construct_block_refno>.
**                    
**                  P_AUTO_UI
**                          Indicates this block supports automatic UI rollout management in calls to 
**                          ClassDesc2::BeginEditParams(), ClassDesc2::EndEditParams(),ClassDesc2::CreateParamDlg(),
**                          ClassDesc2::CreateParamDialog(), etc. 
**                          
*8                          The <auto_ui_parammap_specs> must be supplied in the descriptor constructor. 
**
**      BlockParameter 6:  Because we used the AUTO_UI the following parameters are REQUIRED.
**      
**                      int dialog_template_ID, 
**                              (in this case IDD_COMP_something from an .rc file)
**                      int dialog_title_res_ID, 
**                              (in this case IDS_COMP_something from the String Table)
**                      int flag_mask, 
**                              (This is used by ClassDesc2::BeginEditParams() and ClassDesc2::EndEditParams() 
**                              to determine whether the ParamMap2 shold be created/deleted on this call.  
**                              All the bits in the supplied mask must be on in the Begin/EndEditParams 
**                              flag longuint16_t for the action to take place.  For this example we have 0.)
**                      int rollup_flags 
**                              (This flag is used to control rollup creation.  You may pass
**                              APPENDROLL_CLOSED to have the rollup added in the closed (rolled up) state.  
**                              Otherwise pass 0.)
**                      ParamMap2UserDlgProc* proc
**                              (If there are controls in the dialog that require special processing this user 
**                              If not used then NULL should be passed.)
**                              
**  THE PARAM SPECS:
**
**      Param Parameter 1:  ParamID id
**              (The permanent, position-independent ID for the parameter.  In this case, it is
**              the constant kStartingPoint.)
**      Param Parameter 2:  TCHAR* internal_name
**              (The internal name for the parameter.  In our case "Start Point:".  This is what is written on the
**              button, spinner, whizbang, foozle, etc.)
**      Param Parameter 3:  ParamType type
**              (The type of parameter.  See List of ParamType Choices.   In this case it is TYPE_STRING.  It could be
**              TYPE_INT, TYPE_FLOAT, etc, etc, etc.)
**      Param Parameter 4:  [int table_size]
**              (If the type is one of the Tab<> types, you need to supply an initial table size 
**              which can be 0.  Which it is in our case above.)
**      Param Parameter 5:  int flags
**              (These flags are ORed together.   We don't use any, hence 0.  They include useful things such as
**              p_SubAnim which allow track view acess...)
**      Param Parameter 6: int local_name_res_ID 
**              (Here lies that relatively unique enum mentioned above.  Hence, the kStartingPoint.)
**
**  OPTIONAL STUFF:
**      
**        As param blocks don't necessarily need a visual GUI, any that you include are optional.
**
**        p_ui, 
**          (This declares that a GUI will be instantiated.  The parameter hereafter will declare the type.)
**        GUI_Type
**          (This is the type of GUI that you are going to use.  In our case it is a CUSTOM editbox.
**      
**              NOTE:  MAX prefers that you create CUSTOM instances of all GUI resources (such as spinners, 
**                          editboxes, etc)
**          )
**
**        ID
**          (This is the implementor defined name that this GUI is using.  It is the name of the object that 
**          you created a resource of.  We created an IDC_COMP_STARTINGPOINT which was of a CustEdit type.)
**
**        end
**          (This lets the constructor that makes uses to know that you have finished one of the p_ui param 
**          blocks.)
**          
**
**  FINAL REQUISITE STUFF:
**
**  end
**  );  
**      (This is the conclusion of the Block descriptor.  Sort of intuitive...)
