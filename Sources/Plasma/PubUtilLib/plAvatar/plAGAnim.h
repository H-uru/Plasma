/** \class  plAGAnim
            This class holds reusable animation data. A single plAGAnim can be instanced
            any number of times simultaneously.
            In order to use a plAGAnim, you need a plAGMasterMod, which is a special type of
            modifier which can be attached to multiple scene objects. A master mod is typically
            applied to the root of a scene branch, but there is no requirement that all the scene
            objects animated be children.
            Each plAGAnim has a number of channels, each of which can animate a single parameter
            of a single object. Channels are parametric, i.e. they can carry any data type.
            A plAGAnim carries a name for the animation, and each channel is named as well.
            Instancing a plAGAnim is done via a plAGAnimInstance.
