/** \class plAvTask
    Abstract class for avatar tasks
    A task is an activity which completely occupies the avatar from beginning to end.
    Only one task can run at a time.
    Tasks are queued within a given avatar brain; you can queue several at once, and they'll
    run in succession, with each waiting for the former to complete before running.
    Some tasks are instantaneous (like attaching an animation,) and only use the task model for
    sequencing effect. (i.e., walk here, attach this animation, etc.)
    If your task requires user intervention or control, you probably should
    be using an avatar brain instead. Tasks are meant to sort of run on their own.
