/** \class plAGMasterMod
    A modifier which can apply animations to scene objects. 
    Works together with a plAGModifier, which can apply animation to a
    single scene object. A master modifier hooks up to a family of
    ag modifiers to do its job.
    An animation (plAGAnim) can have many different channels, but the
    user can just pass it to a single master mod to apply it to all the
    channels owned by that master. The master will take care of hooking
    each channel up to an ag modifier.
    The goal is to make an animation a conceptually (and practically) simple
    object to work with, whether or not it has multiple channels.
