/** \class plAGAnimInstance
    Whenever we attach an animation to a scene object hierarchy, we
    create an activation record -- a plAGAnimInstance -- that remembers
    all the ephemeral state associated with animation 
    Since animations have many channels and may involve blend operations,
    one of the primary responsibilities of this class is to keep track of
    all the animation node graphs that were created by the invocation of
    this animation.
