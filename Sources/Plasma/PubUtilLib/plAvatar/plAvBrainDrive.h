/** A simple brain used to steer the player around without regard
    for physics. Used in production to quickly fly through a scene
    without having to actually solve puzzles, jump, etc.
    The 'Drive Brain' uses the same input keys as the avatar, with
    a few secret additions for convenience. At the time of this
    writing, you invoke the drive brain by pressing shift-P, and
    then use the forward and back arrows to move and th e left and 
    right arrows to rotate. The 'u' and 'j' keys will move your avatar
    vertically.
    Gravity and collision are completely suspended for avatars in
    drive mode, but they *can* still trigger region detectors if
    you need to fire off triggers, puzzles, or whatnot.
    Note that the drive brain inherits from the user brain, which
    parses control input for us.
