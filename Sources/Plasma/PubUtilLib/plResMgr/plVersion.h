   59   8/14/02 bob     Anim file format
   60   2/08/03 mf      Changed formats for everything drawable and/or physical. That leaves behaviors, but it's about time for a major version change anyway.
   61   2/18/03 mf      Between my changes and Bob's, we're just not sure what hasn't changed anymore. At least drawables and avatars.
