//  plBSDiffBuffer - A utility class for writing and applying a difference
//                  buffer--i.e. a buffer containing a series of modifications
//                  that will modify an old data buffer to match a new one. 
//                  It's a useful utility class when doing binary file
//                  patching, for example, as you can write out the changes
//                  to this class, get back a data buffer suitable for writing,
//                  then use this class again later to reconstruct the new buffer.
//
//                  This class is copied in structure (not substance) from
//                  plDiffBuffer. It is based on bsdiff-4.1 from BSD
//                  Linux (http://www.daemonology.org/bsdiff). It's *extremely*
//                  hard to read code (written by a PhD), but it works well. The
//                  original BSD code has been modified to have the bzip2 pipes 
//                  it used to compress data removed. It has also been converted
//                  to work a C++ utility class.
//
//                  There isn't really an Add or Copy command in bsdiff. It just
//                  uses three control numbers and two diff/data buffers.
