    //      pointers to the current (possibly modified since load) data. See SnapShot functions
    //      below.
    // RW - Read/Write access to the source data. After closing, this modified source data
    //      will be used to update the buffer data used for rendering.
    // In the normal case of reading the original (disk image) data, performing some operation

    //      loadtime), so the modified source data is, to everyone else, what was read from disk.

    //      unless you've made a snapshot. Normally you would do a RW modify the original data,

    // of multiple types of data that can't be batched into a single drawprimitive call.
