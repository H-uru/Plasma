// Making your own ProxyGen suitable for visualizing class YourObject.
//
// Derive YourObjectProxy() from ProxyGen.
// YourObjectProxy() should set fProxyMsgType and the colors fAmbient,fColor, either
//      in the constructor or in Init().
// Implement IGetNode() (see below).
// Implement ICreateProxy() (see below).
// Implement a CreateProxy() member to YourObject (see below).
// Add DrawableType kYourObjectProxy to plDrawable.h
// Add console commands under Graphics.Show.YourObjectProxy.
// 
// See plLightSpace and plLightProxy for examples.
//
// More details.
// ============
// To make your own ProxyGen, you should subclass plProxyGen and override Init()
// because you'll probably want to keep a pointer to your owner (of type only you
// need to understand). 
// 
// The IGetNode() function lets your owner specify which plSceneNode to place the
// drawable in. That will normally just return your owner's GetSceneNode() call.
//
// ICreateProxy() let's your ProxyGen do any tweaking before calling CreateProxy()
// on your object. Your ProxyGen::ICreateProxy() could just do the work itself, but
// normally doesn't have enough protected information to really do the job.
//
// Typically your object's CreateProxy() function will just translate its internal
// data to a form suitable for the plDrawableGenerator suite of helper functions
// and return the result of a call into one of them.
