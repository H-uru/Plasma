    \brief The animation class for the AniGraph animation system
    WHAT'S AG STAND FOR?
    AG stands for animation graph. It's a directed acyclic graph of animation data sources and operations.

    WHAT'S A CHANNEL?
    A channel is a stream of animation data.
    A channel is a node in an animation graph.
    Animation data can come from anything; keyframes, IK, physics, etc.
    Channels are often grouped together using blending nodes.
    Blending nodes are also a type of channel.
    See where I'm going with this?

    HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM PLCONTROLLER?
    It's very similar, but it's designed to be extremely lightweight; animation graphs are set up and torn down
    quickly and with great frequency. They are not persistent, and their only state (besides cache)
    is their interconnectedness.

    HOW DO THEY GET SAVED?
    Their client must recreate them at read/load time. Since they are stateless, all information necessary
    to recreate them is necessarily held by the client.

    ARE THEY REFERENCE COUNTED?
    No. The entire graph is owned by the creator.
    Deleting the top node of a graph deletes the entire graph.
    If we decide we want to share subgraphs, we'll add reference counting -- easy since cycles are illegal

    HOW DO THEY INTEGRATE WITH PLCONTROLLERS?
    Once we decide the animation graph approach is workable and effective, we'll combine the plController
    concept with the plAGChannel concept.
    Until then, there will be a handful of channel types that adapt controllers into animation graphs.

    WHAT DOES "COMBINE" MEAN?
    Merging more than one types of animation data into a single output that preserves the value
    of both.

    WHAT DOES "BLEND" MEAN?
    Merging two similar types of animation data using a weight to "fade" from one to the other

    WHAT IS ZEROSTATE?
    This is a static channel that always returns the value at time zero. It is used as a reference for animation
    scaling (amplitude).

    WHAT'S AN APPLICATOR?
    In order to cut down on the number of derived channel classes for different Value() and Apply() behaviors,
    applicators were created. At the end of each graph is an applicator, which specifies what should be done
    with the result of a call to Value().
