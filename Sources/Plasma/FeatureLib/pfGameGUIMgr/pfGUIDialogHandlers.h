//  This works very much like the control proc objects. The idea is, if you
//  want to do some custom work on a dialog (and who doesn't?), you create an
//  object derived from this type, override the functions, and do as you
//  please. The class type also derives from the control proc type, meaning
//  that you can implement DoSomething() as well and use the same object for
//  both your dialog and your control procs. (DoSomething() is overloaded here
//  so that it's no longer pure virtual, so you can use it for only handling
//  dialogs if you prefer).
