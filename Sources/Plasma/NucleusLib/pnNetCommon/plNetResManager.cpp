//  Normally, plResManager would be plenty for the servers and then some.
//  However, the normal resManager tries to do things smart, such as read in
//  keys from disk if they don't already exist and so forth. However, all the
//  servers care about is reading in enough of a key to be able to turn around
//  and write it back out to a stream. So, we overload ReadKeyAndReg() to just
//  read in a new key and return it. Our new key reffing system will guarantee
//  that the key eventually gets freed once we're done with it, and we don't
//  care about sharing keys because all we're interested in is the uoid anyway,
//  so no need to store the keys in the registry or anything.
