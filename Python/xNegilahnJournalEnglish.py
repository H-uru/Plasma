Welcome to Negilahn, home of the infamous "tarpin shal" and "bezol pumi"!

Negilahn was one of the first features added to our museum in 8797 at the request of Lord Jerahl. At the time Maintainers and Museum Staff felt that Negilahn had been researched enough to approve the Age for a Museum Pod that would allow our visitors to experience the Age for themselves. 

You will notice that all of our Pods, including Negilahn's, have a few special features. Fortunately, solar power enables our pods to function without outside power sources. However, though our pods will gain power throughout with minimal energy usage, heavy usage will also drain energy units fairly quickly. Be careful to not use up a Pod's energy before nightfall or you may miss out on some sights.  

Before you visit Negilahn, we'd like to take a minute to get you acquainted with the creatures that live there. Please remember that while we have placed our Pod in an optimal position, you are visiting a natural habitat and we have no control over when and where you see our friends in Negilahn…or if you will see anything at all. Our pods do have sound and scent emitters that will attract Negilahn's inhabitants although, again, these are real animals and there are no guarantees. 

Remember too, that all reactions to what you do in Negilahn are not always immediately evident. 

Good luck. 

Negilahn Creature Notes: 

Rather than give away all the secrets of Negilahn, we want you to find creatures on your own. The following notes are only meant to provide you an introduction to the natural habitat of Negilahn. 

We will say that if you can't find "kiris", things aren't going well. The large swarms usually fill the air, especially in the more open spaces. "Kiri" are one of the sole providers of nutrients for the "urwins". If you see a swarm of "kiris", look out; a "urwin" might be nearby. 

"Gipelis" are another of Negilahn's smaller creatures, although they are a much more colorful variety then the "kiri". "Gipelis" can often be seen gliding through the air and are a favorite treat for "reepahs". 

"Nerims" are slow moving and a beautiful native inhabitant of Negilahn. During mating seasons, especially at night, you have a good chance of being witness to some beautiful displays by female nerims. Ask a nearby Museum Guide for more information on nerim mating season. 

Oocha paras, often seen dangling under trees, are actually young "tarpin shals". See if you can follow the "tarpin shals'" life cycle. We'll give you a small hint: you will need to pay close attention to "gahtsai". 

Pumis hunt in packs and often eat the babies of Negilahn's other inhabitants. Pumis will prey on sick, small, or weak adults much larger than them. Pumis like to jump from tree to tree so you'll have to be quick. 

See if you can find what likes to eat pumis. We'll give you a hint: they eat very slowly and live high in the trees.  

Another of Negiliahn's inhabitants are fun-loving creatures that like to eat nerims, "gipeli" and other plants and animals. We'll tell you now that, however, that they are timid creatures and we often find them far away from the pod. If you happen to see a reepah consider yourself lucky. 

Gahtsai are usually pretty easy to spot, especially when they are resting, so we'll let you see if you can find them without any hints. If you see one, notice its stripes; no two patterns are the same. 

Though "urwins" are technically birds, they can't fly! However, with all the "kiri" around, they don't need to. "Urwins" are the only of Negilahn's inhabitants that mate for life and are often seen in pairs. 

If you get the chance to see a "panuhdoy", you'll know why it has the name it does. That's all will tell you. 

The "tarpin shal" is Negilahn's most famous creature and if you get a chance to see one drop down on an unsuspecting animal below it, you'll know why. You'll have to look carefully on the high branches, they are sometimes hard to see but they are worth the effort.

As for any other information, you'll have to find it yourself. Good luck and we hope you enjoy Negilahn. Please ask a Museum Guide if you have any questions or problems.
