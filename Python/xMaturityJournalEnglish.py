<p align=left>Similar to a variety of other cultures, the D'ni celebrated a child's entrance into reason and maturity. The D'ni believed that true maturity, or the Age of Reason as they called it, was achieved at the age of twenty-five. Before that, the D'ni believed that children's minds and hearts were not properly formed. Up until that time they even went so far as to say it was impossible for a child to truly make a correct decision as they were too easily controlled by other motives. That did not mean that what they did was not right or wrong but the D'ni believed that Yahvo did not hold them accountable for those decisions. Up to that point it was apparently up to the parents to judge and protect and thus, another reason society encouraged couples to only have one child at a time under twenty-five.

In the "ceremony of readiness", the D'ni celebrated a child's entrance into reason and maturity. 

At the ceremony, the child was presented with a bracelet of knowledge (also translated "maturity"). I have to admit the translation is somewhat poor and makes it sound like a magical or superstitious item - something it did not sound like to them. In fact, it was a fairly serious item. 

The D'ni viewed the bracelet as a sign of accountability.  The individual, once given the bracelet, was expected to be responsible for his/her actions as he/she had true knowledge of good and evil and the wisdom to make the right choices between both. Associated with the bracelet were certain rights as well as expectations to behave in a more correct manner. 

From a religious standpoint, the "ceremony of readiness" signaled accountability to Yahvo as well as fellow D'ni citizens. No longer were parents judged for the actions of their children on a religious level, and no longer was lack of knowledge an excuse to Yahvo. The Maker, they believed, now expected much more from them. 

Though the Age of Reason was twenty-five, the D'ni did not consider true wisdom to come until much later. With not nearly the fanfare that the Age of Reason brought, at 125 years of age there was another celebration for reaching the Age of Wisdom. Perhaps most importantly, regarding that status, the D'ni were allowed to become highest ranks of teachers or leaders (Grand Masters or Lords). 

The same rules applied to women and no woman under the age of 125 was technically allowed to advise, especially the Kings. As well, it appears that a woman's fertility ended around age 125.

During the time of the Kings, advisors were required for those Kings who were under the age of 125 as the King himself had not achieved the Age of Wisdom. The Great King Ahlsendar was the only King who did not have an official advisor even though he was under the Age of Wisdom for the majority of his reign.
