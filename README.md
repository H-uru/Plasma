Plasma
======

A CMake-based fork of the GPLv3-licensed **CyanWorlds.com Engine** (Headspin/Plasma), with a focus on bug-fixes, cross-platform compatibility, and enhanced features.

Library Dependencies
--------------------

Plasma currently requires the following third-party libraries:

- nVidia PhysX 2.6.4 - http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx_archives.html#SDK
- Creative Labs' OpenAL SDK 1.1 - http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/OpenAL11CoreSDK.zip
- Microsoft DirectX SDK - http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=3021d52b-514e-41d3-ad02-438a3ba730ba
- Python 2.7 - http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
- libOgg and libVorbis - http://www.xiph.org/downloads/
- OpenSSL - http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
- eXpat - http://expat.sourceforge.net/
- libJPEG - http://www.ijg.org/
- libPNG - http://www.libpng.org/
- speex - http://www.speex.org/downloads/
- zlib - http://zlib.net/
- PCRE - http://www.pcre.org/
- libcurl - http://curl.haxx.se/

The following libraries are optional:

- (for building resource.dat) PyGTK - http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html
- (for building resource.dat) PIL - http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
- (for plFontConverter) Freetype - http://freetype.org/

Reducing the use of proprietary libraries is a focus of development and should be expected to change.

PhysX, OpenAL, and DirectX SDK will need to be acquired through the above links.
All other required libraries are available as precompiled binaries and associated files in the [development libraries bundle](http://guildofwriters.org/tools/devlibs.zip) or can be built using their individual build instructions.


Compiling Instructions
----------------------

Currently, compilation only targets Windows systems and requires Visual Studio 2010 or Visual Studio 2012 (including Express Editions).

To compile:

1.  Start **CMake-GUI**.
2.  Set the *Where is the source code* option to the location where you cloned the repository.
3.  Set the *Where to build the binaries* option to a subfolder of the aforementioned location called *build*.
4.  Check the **Grouped** and **Advanced** options.
5.  Press **Configure**. Select *Visual Studio 10* (or your preferred version of Visual Studio) as the generator.
6.  Set the *CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX* option under CMAKE to the *cwe-prefix* folder that you extracted from the [development libraries bundle](http://guildofwriters.org/tools/devlibs.zip).
7.  Press **Configure** again.
8.  Set the *OpenAL include and library path* options under OPENAL.
    - Default Include Path: `C:\Program Files\OpenAL 1.1 SDK\include`
    - Default Library Path: `C:\Program Files\OpenAL 1.1 SDK\lib\win32\OpenAL32.lib`
9.  Press **Configure** again.
10. Set the *PHYSX_SDK_PATH* option under PHYSX. 
    - Default Path: `C:\Program Files\AGEIA Technologies\AGEIA PhysX SDK\v2.6.4\SDKs`
11. Press **Configure**... For the last time!
12. Press **Generate**. You will now have a Visual Studio solution file (.sln) in the folder that you specified to build the binaries in.
13. Open the solution in Visual Studio. You can compile CyanWorlds.com Engine by pressing *Build -> Build Solution*. This will take some time. 


Running Instructions
--------------------

To run the Internal Client for testing with MOULa content, you will need the a fully-patched installation of MOULa provided by Cyan Worlds. In addition, you will need to download or clone the files available on the [moul-scripts repository](https://github.com/H-uru/moul-scripts).

1. Copy the **files from your existing MOULa installation** to a new folder, or install fresh if you do not already have it installed. This folder will be referred to as *MOUL-OS* for the remainder of these instructions.
2. Copy the **Python and SDL** folders from moul-scripts into the *MOUL-OS* folder, as well as the **files in dat** into the existing dat folder.
3. Copy the example_server.ini file from the root of the Plasma repository into your *MOUL-OS* folder, and rename it as **server.ini**. If you are running your own dirtsand server or are connecting to one run by someone else, use the server.ini generated from that.
4. Copy the **DLLs** from the development libraries bundle, as well as the DLLs PhysXLoader.dll, NxExtensions.dll, NxCooking.dll, and NxCharacter.dll from your PhysX SDK installation into the *MOUL-OS* folder.
5. Copy the **resource.dat** file from `<build_dir>\bin` to the *MOUL-OS* folder, or from http://www.guildofwriters.org/tools/resource.dat if you did not build your own.
6. Create a **shortcut** in the *MOUL-OS* folder to the compiled plClient.exe.
7. Edit the shortcut's **properties**, and after the final quotation mark in the *Target* field, add `/LocalData`. Also, change the *Start in* field to the path of your *MOUL-OS* folder.
8. Double-click the shortcut to **connect** to your server and test!

Alternatively, if you wish to be able to debug using a single content folder from inside Visual Studio, you will need to do the following for each Configuration (Debug, Release, etc.) you have:

1. Open the Plasma Solution in Visual Studio.
2. Right-click on the plClient project in the Solution Explorer.
3. Select *Configuration Properties->Debugging*.
4. Enter `/LocalData` in the *Command Arguments* field.
5. Enter your *MOUL-OS* folder path in the *Working Directory* field.

About Non-Free Libraries
------------------------

This software uses some non-free libraries for which exceptions appear in the
source code license inserts. It is suggested that anyone who thinks of doing
substantial further work on this program should first free it from dependence
on the non-free libraries so that it does the same job without the non-free
libraries. Further introduction of non-free libraries likely would require a
revised license and thus permission from all contributors to the codebase.
That being problematic, any additional non-free libraries are unlikely to be
accepted by Cyan Worlds or the development community.
