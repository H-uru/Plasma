      <h2>Get Involved</h2>

      <p>There are plenty of opportunities to get involved, ranging from play testing, to documentation and planning, to a variety of development tasks. We have a <a href="https://github.com/H-uru/Plasma/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contribution Guideline</a> document to help you get started.</p>

      <p>We use GitHub Discussions to propose ideas, solicit feedback, and discuss plans for the development roadmap. We welcome participation from anyone interested in the future direction of the engine development. You can <a href="https://github.com/H-uru/Plasma/discussions">join those discussions on GitHub</a>.</p>


      <h3 id="bug-reports">Reporting Bugs</h3>

      <p>One of the easiest and most useful ways to get involved is by submitting bug reports. After nearly 20 years, there are a lot of issues that are well-known in the player community, but have never been properly documented anywhere. Providing detailed information about these issues is the best way to get them investigated and addressed.</p>

      <p>As the engine code gets updated, it’s also incredibly valuable to have people who play through the existing content and identify new problems.</p>

      <p>For issues involving the game engine or game behaviour, please submit bug reports on the <a href="https://github.com/H-uru/Plasma/issues">H-uru/Plasma GitHub issue tracker</a>.</p>

      <p>For issues involving the game content (journals, textures, visual issues, collision issues), please submit bug reports on the <a href="https://github.com/H-uru/moul-assets/issues">H-uru/moul-assets GitHub issue tracker</a>. Please include as much detail as possible, including a description of where the issue happens and any relevant screenshots.</p>

      <p>If you’re not sure where your bug report belongs, submit it to the H-uru/Plasma issue tracker and we’ll make sure it ends up in the right place.</a>


      <h3 id="development">Development</h3>

      <p>There are a broad assortment of opportunities to help with development of the Plasma engine. Much of the game runtime behaviour is implemented in Python, while the engine itself is C++.</p>

      <p>We attempt to keep a list of “good first issues” for new contributors, which offer opportunities to become familiar with the engine codebase and structure while solving a clearly defined problem. Look for issues <a href="https://github.com/H-uru/Plasma/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHacktoberfest">tagged with Hacktoberfest</a> as starting points.</p>

      <p>A lot of informal development discussion takes place on IRC and Discord. These are great places to ask questions about getting involved, or discuss issues.</p>
